# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise learn how different campaigns faredin relation to the launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
I used the data set to help find out information on how to create and run a successful kickstarter campaign. While doing this for me I had a few challanges. One of the main challenges I incountered was learning to put in the proper formulas for the information that I was asked to obtain. I over came this challange with trial and error and help from outside sources like google.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis I came up with is that the success of the kickstarter is largerly dependent on the amount of money you ask for. Then more you ask for the least likely you will succeed in meeting your goal.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
