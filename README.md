# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise learn how different campaigns fared in relation to the launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
I used the data set to help find out information on how to create and run a successful kickstarter campaign. While doing this for me I had a few challanges. One of the main challenges I incountered was learning to put in the proper formulas for the information that I was asked to obtain. I over came this challange with trial and error and help from outside sources like google.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
What I can determine based on the data is is if you launch your kickstarter during the April May June months, you will be more likely to succeed then starting it during the fall and winter months. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis I came up with is that the success of the kickstarter is largerly dependent on the amount of money you ask for. Then more you ask for the least likely you will succeed in meeting your goal.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The 2 conclusion I came up with for the outcome based on launch data is, most successful campains started during the month of May with June a close second. That I wouldn't recommend starting a campaign during the normal holiday season October thru January. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What I can conclude from outcomes based on goal is if you ask for less then $20,000 you will at a minimum have a 50% chance of success. Even with that you can raise a successful kickstarter asking for more money if you plan correctly start during the time of year.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some of the limitations to this data set is more loacal areas. Yes the united states is there but would fundraising in California for tv skew the numbers against say Kansas?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
